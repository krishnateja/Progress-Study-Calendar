Progress-Study-Calendar
=======================

This is used to book dates on sets. Left click of the mouse gives dotted line and right click of the mouse gives a arrow symbol.

Date button on the top of the page renders conditional highlighted arrows based on the set date being before/after the current date.

If the booked set date is before the current date the arrow is visible in orange color, if its post the current date then the arrow is visible in blue color.
